    <h2>Simple formatting instructions</h2>

    <p>
      Use <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags to enclose a paragraph in html. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code> to enclose a heading. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to force a line break.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two premade <code>div</code> in this document that will hold your visualizations. The first one has id <code>vis1</code>, the second one has <code>vis2</code>. Write your explanation and analysis close to each of your visualizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your first visualization goes here:
    </p>

    <!-- Visualization goes here -->
    <div class='vis-holder' id='vis1'></div>

    <p>
      Your second visualization goes here:
    </p>

    <!-- Visualization goes here -->
    <div class='vis-holder' id='vis2'></div>
    <h2>Dexcriptive Prose:</h2>
    <p>
      1. The dataset that we choose was regarding the total number of covid-19
      cases and deaths in countries all around the world, however to be able to
      not overcrowd the graphs we choose the top 40 highest covid-19 cases. The dataset
      provides details regarding the country, covid-19 cases, covid-19 deaths and region
      specific to the country.
      <a href='https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/'>Countries where COVID-19 has spread</a>
      <br>
      2. The bar chart is an appropriate visual encoding for the first visualization
      because the x-value which is country is a categorical data and the y-value
      for covid-19 cases are quantitative, so it makes sense to create a barchart
      to illustrate this. However, while the second visualization is a line chart and
      shouldn't have used an categorical value for the x-axis, we felt that
      showing both the covid-19 death cases and covid-19 cases on this dataset
      provided an insightful outlook that the death resulting from the virus wasn't
      that significant.
      <br>
      3. The colormap that we used for the two vizualization are static, because
      we wanted our viewers to have a clean and simple design that reveals the stark
      impact covid-19 had on our world.
      <br>
      4. The designs that we choose are mostly simple designs as we wanted to
      provide overview first of the impact covid-19 had on these 40 countries. We
      choose the color red for the cases since red is closely related to danger, which symbolizes
      how dangerous Covid-19 was. On the second visuzalition, we choose the color
      black to represent the death caused by the Coronavirus, because black is the
      color that we normally wear when mourn the dead.
